### Per-Game Channel Configuration

You can specify different announcement channels for each game:

   - Overrides the default channel for that specific game
   - To change a game's channel, simply resubscribe with the new channel

3. **Mixed Configuration**: Use default for some games, specific channels for others
   - Example:
     ```
     [p]patchconfig channel #gaming
     [p]patchconfig subscribe stellaris
     [p]patchconfig subscribe factorio #factorio-news
     ```
   - Stellaris announcements go to #gaming
